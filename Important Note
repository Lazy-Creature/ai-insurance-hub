AI Insurance Hub is a multi-module AI platform designed for the insurance industry, integrating conversational AI, document-based retrieval, SQL query answering, summarization, and graph-based analytics. Users can interact with policies, claims, and risk data through modules like Chatbot, Knowledge Retriever, Policy Advisor, SQL QA, Summarization, and Graph QA. The platform leverages Streamlit for the interface, LangChain for LLM orchestration, FAISS for vector storage, and Neo4j for knowledge graph queries. While all code currently runs in a single directory, it can be organized into separate folders for clarity, with minimal import adjustments.
